MAY
===

May is a collection of modules for mathematical manipulation and audio
analysis and processing with the Yeti (https://mth.github.io/yeti/)
programming language.

Yeti is a functional language that runs on the JVM, and May makes use
of both Java and native Yeti modules.

This is an implementation exercise as much as anything.
